    <p>Paragraphs can vary in length. For example, short paragraphs are used in newspaper stories where the emphasis is
        on reporting information without discussion, or in technical writing where the emphasis is on presenting facts
        such as statistics and measurements without analysis. Written dialogue also consists of short paragraphs, with a
        new paragraph for each change of speaker. In an essay, a short paragraph can also be effectively used for
        dramatic effect or transition.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, paragraphs that are a page or more in length are difficult for most readers, who like to see a
        subject divided into shorter sections. Examine long paragraphs to see whether you have gone beyond covering one
        idea or if you are guilty of repetition, wordiness, or rambling. But don't arbitrarily split a long paragraph.
        Make sure each paragraph meets the requirement of a single main idea with sentences that support it.</p>
    <p>To test the unity of your paragraphs, locate the topic sentence (the clear statement of the paragraph's central
        idea) and then test the other sentences to see if they develop that particular idea or if they wander off in
        another direction.</p>
