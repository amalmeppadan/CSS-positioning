        <p>A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A
            paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs
            are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.A paragraph is a series of
            related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of
            thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea.
            Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument. </p>
